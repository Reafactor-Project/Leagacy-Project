Overview
Design
This project is focused on rapid iteration and continuous deployment. Far above the viability of the application as a 'product' or your team as a potential start-up.

Your teams have been assigned (seen below). You will work with your team to generate project ideas, delegate roles, and build something awesome.

In a real work environment, you'll rarely have the opportunity to choose all of the people you collaborate with. Your success as an engineer will, in large part, be determined by how well you're able to integrate with varied groups of engineers. The ability to contribute to a shared vision and iterate towards it effectively among peers is extremely valuable. This sprint will help you hone that skill.

Greenfield Learning Objectives:

project documentation
group dynamics and collaboration
product implementation
project architecture
product design
During the greenfield project, you must document your code, syntax styling, git workflow, and feature roadmap in sufficient detail so that it can be handed to an arbitrary team with virtually no explanation.

This repo contains templates that you'll use as a guide to successfully document and structure your project on Github. As you begin your project, you'll copy over the templates into a brand-new repo (public) you'll create as part of the process described below --DON'T DO THAT YET (follow the steps).
